## Week 11 Review: The Foundation

This was **Week 11** of my first 12 Week Year cycle. The goal was simple: build a solid foundation for the journe

###  Week's 11 Game Plan 📋
For Week 11 (remember, we count down!), I'm shifting focus to active execution:

Primary Goal: Submit at least ONE bug report (duplicate or not)
Learning: Focus exclusively on XSS and CSRF
Time Allocation: Max 2 hours learning, minimum 3 hours hunting
Targets: Pick 3 programs and go deep instead of wide
